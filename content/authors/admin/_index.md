    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    # summary: |
    #   Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
Elizabeth (Liz) A. O'Gorman is a computational neurobiologist with a Ph.D. in Neurobiology and a concurrent M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering concentrating in Data Analytics and Machine Learning from Duke University. Her research interests include developing and using state-of-the-art computational methods to discover fundamental algorithms and computations used by the brain to produce adaptive behaviors. Methods confine and compliment scientific discoveries --- to that end, her objective is to methods to advance science. Most recently, as a computationalist, she has developed methods for adaptive neuroscience experimentation, and as an experimentalist, she has used these methods to reinforce adaptive behaviors. Ultimately, she is interested in how environment and experience shape adaptive behaviors throughout the lifespan using computational and experimental approaches.
